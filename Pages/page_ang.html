  <h1> David Leturcq </h1> 
  
  For many reasons, I stopped research in summer 2021, and I am now teaching in middle school in France. I am quite happy with the current situation, and I don't plan to resume institutional research at any time. 
 However, I now host my former webpage here in case I decide to publish some unfinished works once.

<h3> Studied topics</h3>
  <div>I worked on knot theory in any dimension, and study invariants defined using some techniques about algebraic intersections or integral of differential forms on configuration spaces. </div>
  <div> In my Ph. D. thesis, I studied  invariants for odd dimensional long knots, which are embeddings of the Euclidean space <b>R<SUP>n</SUP></b> (n at least 3) into spaces obtained by replacing the unit ball of <b>R<SUP>n+2</SUP></b> with a compact manifold with same boundary and same integral homology. These invariants are defined by "counting" particular graphs, whose vertices are allowed to move either on the knot, or in the whole ambient space. Equivalently, these invariants are linear combinations of integrals of forms over configuration spaces which depend on some diagrams and of the knot. In my first article, I gave flexible definitions of these invariants, which were previously defined in a more constrained way, and only for long knots of <b>R<SUP>n+2</SUP></b>. In my second article, these flexible definitions allow us to express the invariants in terms of linking numbers of some cycles in a surface whose boundary is the knot, or, equivalently, in terms of Alexander polynomials.  </div>
  <div> In a third article, I study these invariants for one-dimensional knots in rational homology 3-spheres, and I express them in terms of the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory. 
  The results of the second article then give an expression of the Alexander polynomial in terms of this perturbative expansion. This generalizes a result known for knots of <b>R<SUP>3</b> using finite type invariant theory.</div>
  <div> Lastly, I was working on extending the results of my Ph. D. to the even-dimensional case.  
  I tried to count wider families of diagrams to produce cocycles on spaces of knots.
  I began to define some explicit chains that allow to compute such cocycles.
  I may (or not) resume this work if I feel the need to one day. 
    
 <h3> Ph. D. thesis </h3>
 
 <a href = "http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~dleturcq/0main.pdf "> Here </a> is my Ph. D. thesis "Counting spatial configurations in odd dimension with the Reidemeister torsion". It was done under the supervision of Christine Lescop 
 at Institut Fourier, and I defended on July 3rd 2020.
